# Attendance Management System 
The Attendance Management System, built with Django, automates student attendance tracking, replacing traditional manual methods. 
It enables teachers to mark attendance, monitor percentages, and export records efficiently, while students can view real-time data 
for transparency. This system reduces administrative workload and ensures accurate records.

# Inputs: 
1. Teacher Login/Password Verification: Teachers enter a password to access the attendance dashboard. 
2. Student Registration Data: Input student details, including name, enrollment number, batch, 
semester, and other information during registration. 
3. Attendance Marking: Teachers select students, subjects, and attendance status (e.g., present/absent) 
for each session. 
4. Filtering Criteria: Teachers select filters (batch, semester, subject) to view specific student groups for 
attendance. 
5. Export Request: Teachers select a semester to export attendance records in Excel format.
   
# Outputs: 
1. Teacher Dashboard: Displays filtered lists of students, attendance percentages, and options to mark 
attendance. 
2. Student Dashboard: Shows each studentâ€™s personal attendance percentage and records by subject. 
3. Attendance Records: Updated attendance percentages for each student, both overall and by subject. 
4. Error Messages: Displays messages for invalid inputs, such as incorrect passwords or missing data. 
5. Excel Report: An exportable Excel file with attendance data, showing attendance percentages for each 
student per subject.
