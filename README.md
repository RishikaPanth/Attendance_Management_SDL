# Attendance Management System 
The Attendance Management System is a digital solution designed to streamline the process of tracking and 
managing student attendance. Traditionally, attendance is maintained manually, which is time-consuming and 
prone to errors. This system aims to automate attendance tracking, making it more efficient and reliable for 
both teachers and students. 
Built using Django, a powerful web development framework, the system allows teachers to mark attendance 
for students in various subjects, monitor overall attendance percentages, and export attendance records. 
Students can view their attendance data in real-time, ensuring transparency and enabling them to keep track 
of their performance.  Automating attendance calculations, this system reduces administrative burdens and 
enhances the accuracy of attendance records.
